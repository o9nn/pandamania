# Phase 2 Learning & Adaptation Implementation Summary

## Implementation Date
November 15, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented the next steps for learning & adaptation as part of Phase 2 development. This adds comprehensive learning capabilities to PandaMania while maintaining the core meta-cognitive architecture.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Session-Based Learning System (32 patterns)

**File**: `session_learning.aiml`

#### Capabilities
- **Learning Context Manager**: Tracks session state, learned facts, and preferences
- **Fact Extraction**: Automatically extracts user information from conversation
  - Name recognition (MY NAME IS, I AM, CALL ME)
  - Location tracking (I LIVE IN, I AM FROM)
  - Occupation tracking (I WORK AS, I AM A)
- **Preference Learning**: Captures user preferences
  - Likes and loves
  - Dislikes and hates
  - General preferences
- **Conversational History**: Maintains awareness of conversation flow
- **Meta-Learning Awareness**: Bot understands its own learning process
- **Session Management**: Initialize, status reporting, and reset capabilities

#### Key Patterns
- Session initialization and tracking
- Personal information extraction (name, location, occupation)
- Preference tracking (likes, dislikes)
- Learning mode control (enable/disable)
- Session status reporting
- Meta-cognitive awareness of learning

### 2. Knowledge Base Integration (34 patterns)

## Usage Examples

### Session Learning Example
```
User: My name is Alice
Bot: Nice to meet you, Alice! I've learned your name and
     will remember it during our conversation.
     Meta-cognitively, I'm aware I've just updated my model of you.

User: I work as a software engineer
Bot: I've learned you work as software engineer.
     Meta-cognitively, this occupational context helps me tailor examples
     and explanations to be more relevant to your professional domain.

User: What have you learned?
Bot: In this session, I've learned the following about you:
     - Name: Alice
     - Occupation: software engineer
     Total facts learned: 2
```

### Knowledge Base Example
```
User: Store fact AIML is markup language
Bot: ✓ Stored fact: AIML is markup language
     Meta-cognitively, I've added this to my knowledge base as a
     semantic triple and can now retrieve it or use it in inferences.

User: What is AIML?
Bot: AIML is markup language.
     Meta-cognitively, I retrieved this from my knowledge base
     as a stored semantic fact.
```
